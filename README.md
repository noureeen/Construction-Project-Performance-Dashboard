# 🏥 WIMS Hospital – Project Performance Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a **Project Performance Dashboard for the WIMS Hospital construction project**, built using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard brings together **schedule, cost, manpower, and critical path data** into one interactive view, helping project teams clearly understand performance and make informed decisions.

The focus of this project is not just reporting numbers, but **turning project data into meaningful insights**.

---

## Why This Dashboard?
Large construction projects generate a huge amount of data, but without proper visualization, it becomes difficult to track progress and identify risks.

This dashboard was created to:
- Monitor overall **project health at a glance**
- Compare **planned vs actual progress**
- Identify **critical and near-critical activities**
- Track **manpower deployment trends**
- Monitor **budget and value performance**
- Highlight **schedule risks early**

---
