# 🏥 WIMS Hospital – Project Performance Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a **Project Performance Dashboard for the WIMS Hospital construction project**, built using **Power BI**.  
The goal of this dashboard is to turn complex planning and execution data into **clear, easy-to-understand insights** that help teams track progress, manage risks, and make better project decisions.

The dashboard brings together **schedule, cost, manpower, and critical path data** in one place, giving a complete picture of how the project is performing.

---

## Why this Dashboard?
Large construction projects generate huge amounts of data, but that data is only useful if it can be understood quickly.

This dashboard was created to:
- Monitor overall **project health at a glance**
- Compare **planned vs actual progress**
- Identify **critical and near-critical activities**
- Track **manpower deployment over time**
- Monitor **budget and value trends**
- Highlight **schedule risks before they become delays**

---

## What You Can See in the Dashboard

### Project Summary
At the top level, the dashboard shows key project numbers such as:
- **Baseline Budget:** 690.00M  
- **Total Activities:** 4,880  
- **Critical Activities:** 499  
- **Near-Critical Activities:** 375  
- **Project Duration:** 24 months (729 days)

These KPIs give a quick understanding of the project size and complexity.

---

### Schedule & Progress Tracking
- A **planned vs actual progress gauge** shows how the project is performing against the baseline plan.
- **Critical float filtering** helps focus attention on activities that have little or no float and can impact the final completion date.

---

### Milestone Tracking
Key project milestones are tracked with their baseline finish dates, including:
- Mobilization completion  
- Mock-up rooms  
- Concrete slab completion  
- Long-lead item procurement  
- Testing, commissioning, and handover  

This helps ensure important dates are not missed.

---

### Manpower Insights
- A **monthly manpower trend** shows how labor demand changes throughout the project.
- This helps identify peak periods and supports better workforce planning.

---

### Activity Duration Insights
- The dashboard highlights **long-duration and high-impact activities**.
- These insights help planners and managers focus on areas that can cause delays if not managed properly.

---

### Cost & Value Trends
- Monthly planned values are compared with **cumulative project value**.
- This makes it easier to track spending patterns and understand how value is building over time.
